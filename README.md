# Cricket-scoreboard
It is a simple C code that captures the number of overs, runs scored on each ball, and whether a wicket fell. 
After all the overs are completed, it displays the total runs and total wickets
How the Code Works:
1.The user inputs the number of overs.
2.For each ball in each over, the user inputs the number of runs scored and whether a wicket fell.
3.The code accumulates the total runs and total wickets.
4.If 10 wickets fall before the completion of the specified overs, the game ends early.
5.After all overs (or if all wickets fall), the total runs and total wickets are displayed.
Features:
1.Input validation for the number of runs and whether a wicket fell.
2.Stops the input process if 10 wickets have fallen, as the innings are complete.
